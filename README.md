# Phonebook — C# Academy (Entity Framework)

## ✅ How to run the project

**Prerequisites:** .NET 8 SDK (pinned via `global.json`).

```bash
dotnet run    # starts the app (creates phonebook.db on first run)
dotnet test   # runs the validation unit tests (16 tests)
```

The app is fully usable without any configuration. Email and SMS run in **sandbox mode** by default: they compose the message and show it on screen instead of sending. To send for real, set these environment variables before running:

| Feature | Variables |
|---|---|
| Email (SMTP) | `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM` |
| SMS (Twilio) | `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` |

> Twilio expects phone numbers in E.164 format (e.g. `+27821234567`) for real sends.

## ✅ What the app does and how it works

A menu-driven console phonebook where you can:

- **View** all contacts (name, email, phone, category) in a table
- **Add** contacts with validation — e-mails must look like `name@example.com`, phone numbers must match one of the accepted formats (`+27 82 123 4567`, `082 123 4567`, `(011) 555-0198`, ...) — the prompt tells you what's expected and re-asks until valid
- **Update** and **Delete** contacts by Id
- **Send email** (MailKit/SMTP) and **SMS** (Twilio REST) to a contact
- Categorize contacts: **Family / Friends / Work / Other**

How it works:

- **Entity Framework Core, Code-First**: EF builds the SQLite database (`phonebook.db`) and schema from the C# model on first run (`Database.EnsureCreated()`), and seeds three starter contacts via `HasData()`.
- **SQL transparency**: every query EF sends is printed to the console (including parameter values) so you can see how your C# LINQ translates into SQL — a deliberate learning feature.
- **Error handling**: every database/EF/SMTP/provider operation is wrapped and returns a result tuple; failures show a friendly red message instead of crashing the app.

## ✅ Architectural choices

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/Models` | `Contact` entity + `ContactCategory` enum |
| `src/Data` | `AppDbContext` — SQLite connection, schema config, `HasData` seeding, SQL logging |
| `src/Services` | `ContactService` (EF CRUD), `ValidationService` (name/email/phone), `EmailService` (MailKit), `SmsService` (Twilio REST) |
| `src/Controllers` | `ContactController` — menu flow, validation loops, all use-case orchestration |
| `src/UI` | `UserInterface` — Spectre.Console prompts, tables, format hints, messages |
| `src/Program.cs` | Dependency wiring + top-level exception guard |
| `tests/Phonebook.Tests` | xUnit tests for the validation logic |

Key decisions and why:

- **Entity Framework over Dapper/ADO.NET** — the assignment requirement, and the industry-standard ORM.
- **SQLite** — zero-install, single-file database; ideal for a learning console app.
- **`EnsureCreated()` instead of migrations** — the simplest Code-First path for a fixed schema; migrations are the natural upgrade if the schema grows.
- **Seeding via `HasData()`** — EF-native: seed rows are part of the model configuration and inserted when the schema is created.
- **Categories stored as strings** (`.HasConversion<string>()`) — the DB column reads `"Family"` instead of `0`, and the enum gives compile-time safety in C#.
- **Result-tuple error pattern** — every service method returns `(Success, Data/Message)` and never lets an exception escape, so the UI can always respond gracefully.
- **Sandbox-first communication services** — SMTP/Twilio credentials come from environment variables; without them the app composes and prints the message, so the feature is demonstrable with no secrets in the repo.
- **Spectre.Console** — readable tables and menus for the console UI.
- **Layered separation** — models → data → services → controller → UI keeps concerns isolated and testable; validation is the pure-logic seam covered by unit tests.

## ✅ Reflection

<!-- Personalize this before submitting! -->

Building this project was my first real hands-on experience with an ORM, and the biggest eye-opener was the SQL logging tip. Watching my LINQ queries turn into actual `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE` statements — complete with parameters — made Entity Framework feel much less like magic. I could finally see what `SaveChanges()` was actually doing under the hood.

The Code-First workflow was surprisingly smooth: I wrote a C# class, and EF created a whole database table from it. Seeing the seed data appear in the table on the very first run was a great "it works!" moment.

The hardest part was change tracking. I hit a real bug where updating a contact right after adding it crashed with "another instance with the same key is already being tracked". I learned that EF keeps only one tracked instance per entity key, and that you have to detach a previously-added entity before attaching an updated copy. That was exactly the kind of problem the "handle errors so the app doesn't crash" requirement is about — and it's why every service method in this project returns a result instead of throwing.

If I were to do it again, I'd probably explore EF Migrations instead of `EnsureCreated()`, since that's how real projects evolve their schemas. Next up: sending real emails and SMS with actual credentials, and maybe adding a search feature.
